# Blackjack

This is a simplified version of a Blackjack game. The objective is to, in this case get the sum of 21. If the sum of the cards is greater than 21 the player loses. If the players sum is less than 21 they are able to get a new card.

## Future:
This is the first version of the game. 
I will be adding alot more features, such as:
- The ability to deal chips while keeping track of the cashflow.
- A dealer that plays along side the player.
- The ability to hit or stay.
- the option to double the players chips on eberu hit.
